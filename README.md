# Unity Internship Progress

*  This repo contains everything for my Unity internship as part of Birzeit University Practical training course — including Unity applications and documentation for the lectures.  

*  The training is conducted under the supervision of **Ahmad Naser**, as part of his Unity development program.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- 📚 **Documentation**  
  * Each lecture has a corresponding `.md` file inside the `Documentation/` folder.  
  * Every file includes what I learned, what I completed, and any issues or bugs I faced — along with relevant screenshots.  
 
- 🎮 **Applications**  
  *  The `Applications/` folder includes all the Unity applications created at the end of every section of the course content.
  *  You can open them via Unity Hub and explore or run the scenes.
