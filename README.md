# Unity Internship Progress
🍄 This repo contains everything for my Unity internship as part of Birzeit university course — including Unity applications and documentation for the lectures. 

## 📁 Folder Structure

## 📚 Documentation

All lecture notes are in `Documentation/`, written in Markdown for easy reading and version control. Each file represents a specific lesson or topic covered during the training.

The `Projects/` folder includes full Unity projects created during the internship. You can open them via Unity Hub and explore or run the scenes.

## ✅ Requirements

- Unity (Recommended version: **[Your Version Here]**)
