# Unity Internship Progress

🍄 This repo contains everything for my Unity internship as part of Birzeit University course — including Unity applications and documentation for the lectures.  

## 📁 Folder Structure

- 📚 **Documentation**  
  * 🍄 All lecture notes are in `Documentation/`, written in Markdown for easy reading and version control.  
  * 🍄 Each file represents a specific lesson or topic covered during the training.
 
- 🎮 **Projects**  
  * 🍄 The `Projects/` folder includes full Unity projects created during the internship.  
  * 🍄 You can open them via Unity Hub and explore or run the scenes.
