### ✍️ What I Learned

* Player represents flat box when we are designing.
* We use https://flatuicolors.com/ for picking professional colors.
* Color Cop is a free color picker tool you can download from the internet. It lets you click anywhere on your screen to get the exact color code (like HEX or RGB), which is super useful for designers and developers when matching colors.
