###  ✍️ What I Learned  

Everything starts with the assests folder, it's the heart's project, that's where you place all the project's content:C# scripts, sprites, animations, prefabs, audio files, materials, and UI elements...

I learnt about the assests's components, A component in Unity is like a behavior or ability that you attach to a GameObject to make it do some action.

I focused on these components:
* Rigidbody : This gives your GameObject physics. Like, actual gravity, momentum, forces
* polygon collider: It defines the shape of your object for collisions — but in a very detailed, custom way. it's represented in a green square.
