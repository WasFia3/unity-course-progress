###  ‚úçÔ∏è What I Learned  

I learnt all concoptes of C#, it was easy with a programming background.
The new knowledge i got was how build UI in Unity, dealt with canvas, buttons, text. 

  
### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did / Built  
I wrote two C# scripts.
First script called "printConsol" was to print a "hello *user name*" on the consol after pressing on the greet button.
and to print the answer of a simple math equation on the consol after clicking on the calculate button.

Second Script called "increaser" was to change the text placed on the canvas value, by increasing it by 1 every time i press the button.


### üß™ Problems I Faced  
Button didn't show any text, or was even clickble, the solution of the problem was to import Text mesh button (TMB) essentials.
