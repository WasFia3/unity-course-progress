### ‚úçÔ∏è What I Learned  
I learned all core concepts of C# ‚Äî it was easy thanks to my programming background.  
What was new to me was learning how to build UI in Unity. I worked with Canvas, Buttons, and Text components.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did / Built  
I wrote two C# scripts:

#### 1. `printConsol.cs`
- Printed "Hello *user name*" to the console when clicking the Greet button.  
- Printed the result of a simple math equation to the console via a Calculate button.  
- Counted from 1 to 5 and printed each number to the console.

#### 2. `increaser.cs`
- Updated a text value on the Canvas by increasing it by 1 each time a button is clicked.

### üß™ Problems I Faced  
The button wasn‚Äôt showing any text or responding to clicks.  
**Solution**: I imported the **TextMeshPro (TMP) Essentials** package to fix missing UI functionality.
