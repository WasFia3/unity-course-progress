### ‚úçÔ∏è What I Learned  

I found the core concepts of C# quite manageable due to my programming background.
The new thing i learnt was learning how to implement UI elements in Unity, such as Canvas, Buttons, and Text components.
Additionally, gained practical understanding of scripting within Unity and how it integrates with GameObjects.

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did / Built  
I wrote two C# scripts:

#### 1. `printConsol.cs`
- Printed "Hello *user name*" to the console when clicking the Greet button.  
- Printed the result of a simple math equation to the console via a Calculate button.  
- Counted from 1 to 5 and printed each number to the console.

#### 2. `increaser.cs`
- Updated a text value on the Canvas by increasing it by 1 each time a button is clicked.

### üß™ Problems I Faced  
The button wasn‚Äôt showing any text or responding to clicks.  
**Solution**: I imported the **TextMeshPro (TMP) Essentials** package to fix missing UI functionality.
