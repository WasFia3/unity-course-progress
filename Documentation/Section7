### ✍️ What I Learned

I learned about the **Audio Source** component in Unity. It allows you to play sounds in your game, like background music or sound effects.

- You can attach it to any GameObject.
- Choose an audio clip to play.
- Control playback settings like:
  - Looping
  - Volume
  - Pitch
  - Play on Awake

You can also control it through code:

```csharp
audioSource.Play(); // Starts playing the sound
audioSource.Stop(); // Stops the sound

I also learned about the **Singleton** pattern in Unity.
A Singleton ensures that only **one instance** of a class exists throughout the game, which is useful for things like game managers,
audio managers, or UI controllers.

## Problems I Faced
