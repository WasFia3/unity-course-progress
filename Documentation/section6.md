### ✍️ What I Learned

I learned the differences between **local** and **global** position and rotation, and how the **space context** (self vs. world) affects object transformations in Unity. I also gained an understanding of **quaternions** and how they ensure smooth rotations.

Additionally, I explored **camera behavior**, **MonoBehaviour** methods like `Awake()`, `Start()`, and their roles in Unity’s update cycle. A key distinction is that `Awake()` executes even if the script is disabled, unlike `Start()`.

I also learned how **shaders** and **materials** work, how to **apply textures**, and how to implement camera mechanics such as **following the player** or creating an **FPS perspective**.

### 🛠️ What I Did / Built  

* Created and applied materials using imported textures.  
* Configured textures in the inspector.  
* Built a simple FPS-style camera system.  
* Tested MonoBehaviour methods in simple scripts.
