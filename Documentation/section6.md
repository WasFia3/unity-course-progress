### ✍️ What I Learned

I learned the differences between local and global position and rotation, how space context (self vs world) affects object transformations, and how Unity uses quaternions for smooth rotations. I also explored cameras, MonoBehaviour methods like `Awake()`, `Start()`, and update cycles. I learned about shaders and materials, how to upload textures, and how to make the camera follow the player or create FPS views.

### 🛠️ What I Did / Built  

* Created and applied materials using imported textures.  
* Configured textures in the inspector.  
* Built a simple FPS-style camera system.  
* Tested MonoBehaviour methods in simple scripts.
