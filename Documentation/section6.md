### ✍️ What I Learned  
* I learned the differences between local and global position and rotation, how space context (self vs world) affects object transformations, and how Unity uses quaternions for smooth rotations. I also explored camera setups and perspectives.
* I learned how to upload a texture and how to create material using it.
* I learned about MonoBehaviour, and tested the most important methods such as: awake(), starat(), update(), fixedUpdate(), lateUpdate().
* I learned more about cameras and how to make a camera follow a target, and how make a first perspective view like in shooting games.
